  abstract	= {In this paper we investigate if simple change detection
		  algorithms can be combined and used to create a more robust
		  change detection algorithm by leveraging their individual
		  peculiarities. We use Genetic Programming to combine the
		  outputs (i.e. binary masks) of the detection algorithms
		  with unary, binary and $n$-ary functions performing both
		  masks' combination and post-processing. Genetic Programming
		  allows us to automatically select the best algorithms,
		  combine them in different ways, and perform the most
		  suitable post-processing operations. Using different
		  experimental settings, we created two algorithms that we
		  named IUTIS-1 and IUTIS-2 ("In Unity There Is Strength").
		  These algorithms are compared against state-of-the-art
		  change detection algorithms on the video sequences and
		  ground truth annotations of the ChandeDetection.net (CDNET
		  2014) challenge. Results demonstrate that starting from
		  simple algorithms we can achieve comparable results of more
		  complex state-of-the-art change detection algorithms, while
		  keeping the computational complexity affordable for
		  real-time applications. Moreover, when our framework is
		  applied to more complex algorithms, the resulting IUTIS-3
		  outperforms all the 33 state-of-the-art algorithms
		  considered.},
