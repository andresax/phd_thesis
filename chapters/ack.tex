Aside from the institutional acknowledgements, I also want to thank all the people who supported me in these four years of PhD. 
I am especially grateful to my Sara, that will be soon my wife; she has been close to me for all this time and she went through my deadline madnesses and my overnight clikkety clikings.
I thank my mother,  Gianni, and all my family that, for better or for worse, they had took a huge role in who I am.
I thank my old and new friends and my PhD companion who shared with me all the joy and sorrow of these four years, in particular, Francesco.  
I thank of course my advisor Matteo who supported me financially, but especially who drove me through the crowded jungle of academics.
Finally, I want to acknowledge Prof. Marc Pollefeys who kindly hosted me in his laboratory and AmaÃ«l Delaunoy who gave me useful advices and in-sights about Multi-View Stereo.
