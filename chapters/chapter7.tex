The reconstruction method described in Chapter \ref{ch:manif}, builds a manifold mesh from a set of sparse data. 
The outcome captures the coarse geometry of the mesh, however, the reconstruction still lacks to capture the fine-grained details, even after the mesh sweeping proposed in Chapter \ref{ch:sweeping}.
In this chapter we aim at recovering the details of the geometry of the scene, incrementally, by means of variational optimization which directly evolves the surface of the scene according to images. 
We present a fully automatic pipeline to incrementally estimate the accurate reconstruction. 
In particular the method described is able to handle a multi-resolution mesh, and, instead of merging accurate submaps of the scene a posteriori and off-line, it combines online the reconstruction refined with the variational algorithm together with the new rough manifold estimated with the algorithms presented in the previous chapters.

\section{Rationale}

Classical Multi-View Stereo methods \cite{gargallo2005bayesian,delaunoy_et_al_08} limits their application to batch processing and small-scale reconstructions.
The reasons are related both to the computational and memory resources needed to handle big set of images, and to the limitations of the optimization procedures that needs all the images at the same time.

In Chapter \ref{ch:soa} we saw that very few purely volumetric approaches have been proposed to incrementally build a model of the scene, as the algorithm proposed in this thesis (Chapter \ref{ch:manif}), or in \cite{lovi_et_al_11,hoppe2013incremental,litvinov_lhuillier_13}; however, as these algorithms are  only able to deal with sparse point and provide a rough reconstruction, not comparable to the \mvs results.

Recently, a very popular approach to  incremental dense reconstruction is based on depth maps\cite{pollefeys_et_al_08,collins1996space,newcombe2010live,ohtake2003multi,stuhmer2012parallel,stuckler2014multi} ; it first estimates the depth map for a selected set of keyframe, then it merges the depth maps into a single consistent 3D model of the scene, which usually relies on a voxel-based volumetric representation of the so called Truncated Signed-Distance Function (TDSF), therefore it is not suitable for large-scale reconstruction. 
Sch{\"o}ps \etal \cite{schops20153d} propose then to use voxel hashing together with a careful filtering of noisy depth data to deal with large scenes; the results are remarkable, but the resulting model is a non-continuous mesh, and the meshing step is not directly driven by the images, but by marching cubes \cite{lorensen1987marching} that interpolates the TSDF, as in most of the depth map based approaches.

Mesh-based algorithms represent an effective alternative to depth-maps and volumetric based reconstructions. Labatut \etal \cite{labatut2007efficient} estimate directly a visibility and photo-consistent mesh from the Delaunay triangulation of the 3D noisy points obtained from the depth maps.
Vu \etal  \cite{vu_et_al_2012} improve this algorithm by estimating an initial visibility-consistent mesh then by evolving the mesh such that it maximizes the photo-consistency with respect to the images. 
These Delaunay-based volumetric approaches are able to handle large scale scenes, but both \cite{labatut2007efficient} and \cite{vu_et_al_2012}  are not incremental.
Moreover, in the remarkable work of Vu \etal \cite{vu_et_al_2012}, the reconstruction pipeline   is not fully automatic, since  method proposed to estimate the initial mesh does not guarantee that manifold property holds for the whole model.



In this chapter we propose a framework to overcome the previous limitation and reconstruct a continuous and photo-consistent manifold mesh. 
We propose a fully automatic pipeline that integrates the method presented in the Chapter \ref{ch:manif}  with an accurate surface evolving refinement step applied incrementally thanks to a novel manifold-preserving mesh merging algorithm.


\section{System Overview}
 Our fully automatic and incremental pipeline combines three steps to reconstruct a photo-consistent model of the environment: \emph{manifold reconstruction}, \emph{mesh merging} and \emph{windowed photo-metric refinement} (Figure \ref{fig:architecture}).
 The inputs of our system are the 3D points position, the camera poses and the visibility rays, estimated by any incremental SfM or SLAM algorithm such as the method implemented in openMVG \cite{moulon2012openmvg} or \cite{moulon2012adaptive} or ORB-SLAM \cite{mur2015orb}. 
 Every  $W$ frames the system outputs the available reconstruction.

  \caption{Architecture of the parallel and incremental reconstruction system}
  \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}


The first step   builds incrementally a manifold mesh  from Structure from Motion 3D points and camera poses up to time $t$. We applied the algorithm described in Chapter \ref{ch:manif} that outputs a mesh $\mathit{M}_{0..t}$. The mesh  $\mathit{M}_{0..W}$ is a first rough initialization for the subsequent step. We combine all the subsequent meshes $\mathit{M}_{0..kW}$, with $k>1$, with the refined ones $\mathit{M}_{0..(k-1)W}^{\text{opt}}$. 
In this step we enforce the manifold property to consistently apply the mesh evolution process.
The second step is dedicated to the windowed variational refinement of the current mesh, which evolves the surface to maximize the photo-consistency between pairs of cameras.
To keep the pipeline scalable, we compare a constant number $W$ of camera pairs instead of comparing all the possible pairs of cameras. 
Therefore, in our incremental setting, the choice of the camera pairs we would compare is crucial to enable a good trade-off between  accuracy and scalability.
% We propose a novel algorithm that chooses the best camera pairs based on the mutual per-pixel mean parallax angle we compute by relying on the existing model of the scene.

The output $\mathit{M}_{0..kW}^{\text{opt}}$ of this module is the current incremental optimized mesh, \ie, the output of the whole system.
%This approach reaches very accurate results and have been proved to scales well with large-scale scenes \cite{vu2011large}.
In the third step we merge the output of refinement, \ie,   $\mathit{M}_{0..(k-1)W}^{\text{opt}}$  and the new manifold $\mathit{M}_{0..kW}$ with a novel approach that keeps the manifold property and updates the topology. 
The output of this module is the multi-resolution mesh $\mathit{M}_{0..kW}^{\text{merged}}$ that feeds the refinement module.
After such multi-resolution merging step the refinement algorithm is able to jointly refine both the newly added region together with the refined part.

% \begin{mdframed}[hidealllines=true,backgroundcolor=blue!20]
Let notice that this pipeline does not comprise the mesh sweeping algorithm proposed in Chapter \ref{ch:sweeping}; indeed, for a computational perspective, even if the mesh sweeping showed undeniable advantages, its implementation is still computational expensive compared to reconstruction from sparse points and mesh refinement.
However, incremental SfM applied to a subset of publicly available datasets we used, showed good reconstruction quality, such that we were able to refine the initial manifold without local minima issues.
% \end{mdframed}

In the following we describe the refinement and the merging step since the incremental manifold reconstruction from the sparse points of the Structure from motion, is described in Chapter \ref{ch:manif}.

\section{Windowed variational refinement}
\label{sec:Incremental_photoconsistent}
Once a new set of $W$ frames have been processed to possibly update the current model with a new region of the scene, we refine it photometrically. 
The approach adopted in our system is framed into the variational problem of finding a convenient function (the reconstructed surface) that  accurately represents the image data.
The variation of an energy function $E$ induced by a vector field $v$ on a surface $\mathit{S}$, leads to the functional gradient
\begin{equation}
\label{eq::calculus}
 DE(\mathit{S})_v = \left.\frac{\partial E(\mathit{S} + \epsilon v)}{\partial \epsilon} \right|_{\epsilon=0} = \int_{\mathit{S}} \nabla E(x)v(x) dx.
\end{equation}

Our surface refinement algorithms minimize an energy:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:en}
E = E_{\textrm{photo}} + E_{\textrm{smooth}} ,
\end{equation}
where  $E_{\textrm{photo}}$ represents the energy induced by photo-consistency with the images, and $E_{\textrm{smooth}}$ is a prior energy that usually enforce the smoothness of the surface.  

We first describe how we minimize the first term which encodes the photo-consistency.
Let consider two images $I$ and $J$, and the surface reconstructed $\mathit{S}$ (Figure \ref{fig:cameraproj}). Let $x$ and $\overrightarrow{n}$ be a point on this surface and the corresponding normal. 
We define a function $err^S_{I, J}(x_i,\overrightarrow{n})$ which is the photo-metric similarity measure defined on the surface domain, and a visibility function $v^{\mathit{S}}_{ij}(x)$ that is equal to 1 where the surface is visible from both $I$ and $J$, otherwise is 0. 
In the early approach of Faugeras \etal \cite{faugeras2002variational} the energy $E_{\textrm{photo}}$ is integrated on the surface, and becomes:
\begin{equation}
 E_{\textrm{photo}} = \sum_{i,j}\int_{\mathit{S}} v^{\mathit{S}}_{ij}(x) err^S_{I,J}(x, \overrightarrow{n}) d\mathit{S}
\end{equation}


In our case we prefer to minimize  over the images, as in \cite{pons2007multi}, such that we rely directly on the data.
The function $err^S_{I, J}(x,\overrightarrow{n})$ becomes 
$err_{I, J}(x)$ that decreases if the similarity between the patch around the projection of $x$ in  $J$ and $I$ increases.
The energy $E_{\textrm{photo}}$ in Equation \eqref{eq:en} becomes:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:energy_photo}
  E_{\textrm{photo}} = \sum_{i,j}\int_{\Omega^{\textrm{S}}_{i,j}} err_{I, I_{ij}^{\mathit{S}}}(x_i)\textrm{d}x_i = \sum_{i,j} \mathit{err}^{im}_{ij}(x)
\end{equation}
where the term $I_{ij}^{\mathit{S}}$ represents the reprojection of the image from the $j$-th camera in the image $I$ through the surface $\mathit{S}$
(Figure \ref{fig:cameraproj}).
The reasons to choose the latter energy are twofold: we do not explicitly need to consider the visibility and we directly compare the images in their natural domain.

Classical approaches in Computer Vision both in surface evolution and in other reconstruction methods, such as voxel-based ones, optimize the energy over a continuous representation of the surface then they discretize the minimizing flow to evolve the mesh-based representation \cite{pons2007multi,faugeras2002variational}. Recently a more coherent approach shows better results \cite{vu_et_al_2012,delaunoy_et_al_08}: it is named discretize-then-optimize and it directly takes into account the mesh representation during the optimizing procedure. 
Therefore we now modify Equation \eqref{eq::calculus} in order to take into account that  surface $\mathit{S}$ is represented by a triangular mesh.

Let $X_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ be a mesh vertex. The discrete vector field $v$ associates to each $i$-th vertex a vector $v_i$ defined such that $v(x) = \sum_i \phi_i(x) v_i$, where $\phi_i(x)$ are the barycentric coordinates if $x$ is in the triangle containing $X_i$, then,  otherwise $\phi_i(x) = 0$ (in Appendix \ref{app:barycentric_} we explain barycentric coordinates).



\begin{figure}[t]

  \def\svgwidth{200pt}
  \input{./img/ch-incr-dens/cameproj.pdf_tex}
\caption{Variables involved in the photometric refinement process}.
\label{fig:cameraproj}
\end{figure}

The Equation \eqref{eq::calculus} of the gradient functional becomes:
\begin{equation}
  DE(\mathit{S})_v = \sum_i v_i \int_{\mathit{S}} \phi_i(x) \nabla E(x) \textrm{d}x.
\end{equation}

And the discrete version of this gradient computed for a single vertex of the mesh becomes:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\textrm{d}E(\mathit{S})}{\textrm{d}X_i} =  \int_{\mathit{S}} \phi_i(x) \nabla E(x) \textrm{d}x.
\end{equation}

In our case we need to compute the gradient of the energy defined in Equation \eqref{eq:energy_photo}:
\begin{equation}
  \nabla E_{\textrm{photo}} = \nabla (\sum_{i,j} err^{im}_{ij}(x)) = \sum_{i,j} \nabla err^{im}_{ij}(x).
\end{equation}
Let's suppose the point $x$ projects in points $x_i = \Pi_i(x) \in I$ and  $x_j = \Pi_j(x) \in I_j$, then, the vector $\mathbf{d}_i$ goes from camera $i$ to point $x$, $z_i$ is the depth of $x$ in camera $i$, and $\overrightarrow{n}$ is the normal at $x$ pointing outward the surface $\mathit{S}$. 
With the change of variable $\textrm{d}x_i = -\overrightarrow{n}^T \mathbf{d}_i \textrm{d}x/z_i^3$ (see Appendix \ref{app:change}):
\begin{align}
 \begin{split}
  \nabla err^{im}_{ij}(x)& =-\overrightarrow{n} \left( \partial_2 err_{I, I_{ij}^{\mathit{S}}}(x_i) DI_j(x_j) D\Pi_j(x)\frac{\mathbf{d}_i}{z_i^3}\right)=\\
  &= - f_{ij}(x_i) \overrightarrow{n}/z_i^3.
 \end{split}
\end{align}
    
where operator $D$ represents the derivative and $\partial_2 err_{I, I_{ij}^{\mathit{S}}}(x_i)$ is the derivative of $err_{ij}(x)$ with respect to the second image.


We then are able to rewrite the discrete gradient:
\begin{align}
 \begin{split}
\label{eq:final}
  \frac{\textrm{d}E(\mathit{S})}{\textrm{d}X_i} &=  - \int_{\mathit{S}} \phi_i(x) \sum_{i,j} \nabla err^{int}_{ij}(x) \textrm{d}x \\
&=  - \sum_{i,j} \int_{\mathit{S}} \phi_i(x)  f_{ij}(x_i)  \overrightarrow{n}/z_i^3 \textrm{d}x \\
& =  - \sum_{i,j} \int_{\mathit{S}} \phi_i(x)  f_{ij}(x_i)  \overrightarrow{n}/z_i^3 \frac{z_i^3}{\overrightarrow{n}^T \mathbf{d}_i }\overrightarrow{n} \textrm{d}x_i
 \end{split}
\end{align}
% 
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:final}
%   =  - \sum_{i,j} \int_{{\Omega_{i,j}}} \phi_i(x)  f_{ij}(x_i)  \overrightarrow{n}/z_i^3 \frac{z_i^3}{\overrightarrow{n}^T \mathbf{d}_i }\overrightarrow{n} \textrm{d}x_i
% \end{equation}

where $\Omega_{i,j}$ represents the surface region that induces the projection of image $I_j$ into the image $I_i$.
The summation in \eqref{eq:final} can be applied incrementally to the subset of the whole images according to those viewing the current mesh $M_{0..t}^{\text{merged}}$.

% To minimize the term $E_{\textrm{photo}}$, in the batch approach proposed in \cite{vu_et_al_2012}, the authors apply  the gradient descent optimization by moving the vertices of the mesh.
% According to Equation \eqref{eq:final}, for each vertex, they collect the gradient contributions from each incident facet and from each pair of cameras viewing the vertex itself.
% In our incremental case we could simply modify this process to take into account the cameras and images up to the current time and all the possible pairs. 
% However this often would cause drifting in the evolution process: in a typical incremental scenario illustrate in Figure \ref{fig:increm}(a), we evolve the surface with only a subset of cameras; therefore, the gradient collected in $v$ receives contributions  only from small baseline pairs of cameras, e.g., $C_1-C_2$, $C_1-C_3$ and $C_2-C_3$, which induce high uncertainty in the estimation.
% Instead, in the batch case of Figure \ref{fig:increm}(b), wide baseline and  small baseline pairs symmetric to $C_1$, $C_2$ and $C_3$ pairs contributions are able to nicely mitigate this effect.
% 
% 
% Since we are dealing with incremental data, in general, we cannot predict where new images are going to be captured, however we propose to mitigate the issue described thus far, by including a parallax weight in the gradient contributions that favors good baseline against small or too wide pairs.
% We turn Equation \eqref{eq:final} into:
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:my_final}
%   \frac{\textrm{d}E(\mathit{S})}{\textrm{d}X_i} = 
%   \sum_{i,j} \int_{\Omega^{\textrm{S}}_{i,j}} 
%   \phi_i(x)  \mu(x) \nabla err^{im}_{ij}(x)\frac{z_i^3}{\overrightarrow{n}^T \mathbf{d}_i }\overrightarrow{n} \textrm{d}x_i,
% \end{equation}
% where we compute the weight $\mu(x)$ from the angle $\theta$ between the viewing rays of the current pair of cameras incident in $x$ as:
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:weight}
% \mu(x) = min\left\{1.05* e^{-\frac{(\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta)^2}{2*\frac{\pi}{4}^2}},1\right\}.
% \end{equation}
% Equation \eqref{eq:weight}  represents the value of an un-normalized Gaussian centered in $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and standard deviation $\frac{\pi}{4}$, indeed the more the parallax is close to $\frac{\pi}{2}$ the more accurate the estimation. 
% We rely on this guideline also to choose the best pairs of cameras in the evolution process.

% \end{figure} 
% 



On the other hand, we minimize the energy $E_{\textrm{smooth}}$ as in \cite{vu_et_al_2012} by means of the Laplace-Beltrami operator approximated with the umbrella operator \cite{wardetzky2007discrete}, which moves each vertex in the mean position of its neighbors (see Section \ref{sec:sm}).

During this iterative process we increase the resolution of the mesh through One-to-four midpoint subdivision algorithm (Section \ref{sec:onefour}) until a triangle project in each images with an area smaller than 16 pixels.

\subsection{Implementation Details}
The photometric refinement highly rely on GPU processing; we use OpenGL library \cite{opengl} and the GLSL shaders. As shown in Section \ref{sec:opengl_sweep} OpenGL natively manage the projection of one image to another through a model by means of texturing and rendering processes.

In Figure \ref{fig:openglIncrRef} we illustrate how we implemented the photometric refinement, of a mesh $\mathit{M}$ with respect to two images $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ captured by $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$.
As a first step we send $\mathit{M}$  to  the GPU; we compute the depth of the mesh from the two point of view of camera $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ to define the visibility (\emph{Depth} block).
We project $I_{2}$ to the model and we render it to $C_{1}$ (\emph{Reprojection} block) and we compare this projection with the original image $I_{1}$ captured by camera $C_{1}$ to compute the NCC, the block-wise mean and variance  in a $5x5$ px neighborhood (\emph{NCC} block).
The outputs are needed to compute the $\partial_2 err_{I_i, I_{ij}^{\mathit{S}}}(x_i)$ (\emph{Similarity Gradient} block), which in turn is used to compute per-pixel $f_{ij}(x_i)  \overrightarrow{n}/z_i^3 \frac{z_i^3}{\overrightarrow{n}^T \mathbf{d}_i }\overrightarrow{n}$ of Equation \eqref{eq:final} (\emph{Gradient Flow} block). 
Finally, for each vertex, we finally collect the contributions over each incident triangle (\emph{Collect Gradient} block); we apply the resulting vector to the vertex and we compute its new position.

\section{Manifold-preserving Mesh Stitching}
\label{sec:Mesh_merging}
One of the key steps of our incremental pipeline to work fully automatic is the manifold-preserving mesh merging which aims at jointly merging two meshes with different resolutions, and keeping the manifold property valid.

We propose an approach different from existing methods such as \cite{turk1994zippered} and \cite{VuPhD011} which deal with meshes with similar resolution and significant overlap.
Indeed, in our case, we need to merge two meshes with  different resolutions, \ie, the refined and the rough meshes, such that, when they overlap, we  keep the refined part and reject the rough one; moreover,  since the refined mesh could evolve significantly far from the low resolution one, the meshes sometimes does not have a good overlap.



The idea of our mesh merging is to estimate narrow corresponding paths that become boundaries of the two meshes; then connect the endings of these paths and treat such polygonal line as a hole of the joint mesh and fill it with a manifold-preserving hole filling algorithm.

% Let  $f_j \in \mathit{M}$ and $f_i^{\text{opt}} \in \mathit{M}^{\text{opt}}$ be the facets of the two mesh.

\end{figure}

Let $\mathit{M}$ and  $\mathit{M}^{\text{opt}}$ be the new manifold and the refined mesh, \eg, blue and green meshes in Figure \ref{fig:mesh_merging}(a). 
We build the bounding boxes around the facets of the two meshes, and we detect which box from the new mesh intersect a box from the refined mesh, then, we remove the corresponding facets, e.g, the boxes around the red facets in Figure \ref{fig:mesh_merging}(b) mutually intersects, and we remove the facets from the new mesh in Figure \ref{fig:mesh_merging}(c).

Once the facets have been removed, $\mathit{M}$ splits into a set of connected submeshes; we select the biggest submesh, named  $\mathit{{M}^{big}}$.
We order the edges of boundary of $\mathit{{M}^{big}}$ into a list $\mathit{b} = \{b_1, \dots,  b_n\}$.
Let $T_{\text{init}}$ be the number of the triangle of  $\mathit{M}$; if the triangles of $\mathit{{M}^{big}}$ are lower than a threshold $\tau_{bm}=30\% (T_{\text{init}})$, it means that the overlapping with the refined mesh is predominant and we stop the merging process, keeping the refined mesh as output.

If the process continues, we retrieve the set of bounding boxes around the facets adjacent to the border $\mathit{b}$, and we find the set $\mathit{F}^{\text{opt}}$ of facets  belonging to the refined mesh which intersects these bounding boxes, \eg, the red facets  in Figure \ref{fig:mesh_merging}(d).
The boundary edges of $\mathit{F}^{\text{opt}}$ populate the list  $\mathit{b}^{\text{opt}} = \{b_1^{\text{opt}}, \dots,  b_m^{\text{opt}}\}$, and, among these edges, we select the vertices  $v_{\text{start}}^{\text{opt}}$ and $v_{\text{end}}^{\text{opt}}$ which are the vertices nearest to the extremity $v_{\text{start}}$ and  $v_{\text{end}}$ of the boundary $\mathit{b}$ (see Figure \ref{fig:mesh_merging}(d)). 
We estimate the path  $\mathit{b}^{\text{fin}}$ from $v_{\text{start}}^{\text{opt}}$ to $v_{\text{end}}^{\text{opt}}$ among the edges of the facets  $\mathit{F}^{opt}$ such that it minimizes the energy:
\begin{equation}
  E_{\text{path}} = \sum_i E(b_i^{\text{opt}})= \sum_i \angle (\overrightarrow{n}_i^{\text{opt}},\overrightarrow{n}_i^{\text{new}})
\end{equation}
where $\overrightarrow{n}_i^{\text{opt}}$ is the normal of the facet among $\mathit{F}^{opt}$ adjacent to  $b_i^{\text{opt}}$; and
$\overrightarrow{n}_i^{\text{new}}$ is the normal of the facet defined by the two extremities $A$ and $B$ of edge ${b}^{\text{opt}}$ and the nearest vertex $C \in \mathit{b}$.
We minimize $E_{\text{path}}$ with the Dijkstra algorithm  and we extract the final boundary $\mathit{b}^{\text{fin}} = \{ b_1^{\text{fin}}, \dots, b_s^{\text{fin}}\}$ (Figure \ref{fig:mesh_merging}(e)).

Finally, we connect $v_{\text{start}}^{\text{opt}}$ to $v_{\text{start}}$  and $v_{\text{end}}^{\text{opt}}$ to  $v_{\text{end}}$ such that we create a closed polyline $\{v_{\text{start}}^{\text{opt}},  v_{\text{start}}, \mathit{b}, v_{\text{end}}^{\text{opt}}, v_{\text{end}}, \mathit{b}^{\text{fin}}\}$, that we fill with the manifold-preserving algorithm proposed in \cite{liepa2003filling}  (Figure \ref{fig:mesh_merging}(f)). 
To handle the possible topology change of the mesh, we iterate this process for all the boundaries of the mesh  $\mathit{\bar{M}}_{0..kW}$, not negligible, \ie, smaller than $\tau_{\text{top}}= 15\%$ the biggest boundary.

The final mesh $\mathit{M}^{\text{merged}}$ is composed by all the facets from the refined mesh $\mathit{M}^{\text{opt}}$ which have not been removed by the previous process, the submeshes kept from the new mesh $\mathit{M}$ and finally the facets created to fill the polylines.



\section{Experimental Evaluation}
\label{sec:exp}
We tested the proposed system in order to stress the flexibility of the approach both for small objects and for large-scale scenes.
In these experiments we used two classical \mvs datasets to test the generality of our approach with  images that do not comes from a video  sequence; we therefore cannot apply the Edge-Point reconstruction which rely on feature tracking. 
Therefore, we bootstrap our algorithm from the points, cameras and visibility rays extracted by the incremental pipeline provided by openMVG \cite{openMVG}. 
In Table \ref{fig:expData} we list the features of each dataset, and the statistics of the reconstruction: number of reconstructed surfaces, number of mesh merging steps and window size, which is chosen to stress the iterative nature of the proposed algorithm.
We performed the experiments on a 4 Core i7-920 CPU at 2.6Ghz (8M Cache), with 16GB of DDR3 SDRAM and a GPU Nvidia GT630M.

In the first experiment, we tested our approach with the \emph{dinoRing} dataset  from the Middlebury evaluation proposed in \cite{seitz2006comparison}. 
The dataset is composed by 48 640x480 images; in Table \ref{tab:dinoRes} we report the comparison with the top ranked algorithm \cite{savinov2016semantic}, which is voxel-based, together with the other mesh-based algorithm closer to our proposal.
Our algorithm reaches a less accurate result, but  the output is comparable with batch state-of-the art algorithms, despite two big restrictions we are forced to work with.
First, our algorithm is the only technique  which estimate incrementally the surface; it considers the images as a sequence and compares only subsequent images, \ie, image $k$ with image $k-1$.
Second, we cannot exploit any silhouette information, and the visuall hull, since it cannot be estimated in general scenes.

Figure \ref{fig:dinoIncr} illustrates the incremental reconstruction of dino: the red circles underline the topology changes handled by our mesh merging algorithm.

Then we experimented our approach with the \emph{castle-P18} dataset provided in \cite{strecha2008} (Figure \ref{fig:castleOriginal}); no ground truth is available, but it is the only sequence of the dataset able to show the incremental behavior of our approach, since subset of cameras observe parts of the scene. 
The Figure \ref{fig:castle} shows the results, and Figure \ref{fig:detailcastle} displays details of the reconstruction before and after the refinement. The final reconstruction is accurate  an detailed, especially with respect to the initial rough mesh.
Moreover, we successfully reconstructed the odometry sequences 00, 03, 04, 05, 07 and 08 of the KITTI dataset \cite{geiger_et_al12} we skipped sequence 01 since openMVG was not able to recover the point cloud, and we reconstructed at most 1000 frames to avoid loop closures which are not handled explicitly in our scenario (Figure \ref{fig:kitti} and Figure \ref{fig:kitti2}). We stress that all frames have been considered at full resolution without any sampling, \ie, no keyframe policy was implemented, in order to underline the scalability of our approach, and the sequence is considered as monocular, which, in this case is a very challenging setting, since the parallax between cameras is very small, therefore it is hard to reconstruct a precise model.
Let notice in Table \ref{fig:expData} that in both \emph{castle-P18} and KITTI experiments the number of the reconstructed facet is huge, but all the computations have been performed in memory without the need to dump any data on disk. Indeed the volumetric stage of our algorithm, \ie, the incremental manifold reconstruction, extracts only a  simplified mesh, which is successively refined relying on a mesh-based representation.
