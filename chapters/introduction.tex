\label{sec:intro}
We are in the era of autonomous driving; cars are becoming endowed with many sensors, and they need to acquire information from them to navigate and localize in the surrounding.
As humans use mostly vision among their senses to perceive and act, the cars, robot or in general machines could heavily rely on image data to interact with the environment.
Computer Vision and Robotics are the two narrow field of research which are involved in this process. 
Computer Vision processes images to extract meaningful information such as the class the subject belongs to, the action happening in the scene or the 3D model of the environment.
Robotics aims at designing robots, or autonomous machines, and making them work in the real world.

a strong need of accurate maps of the environment is arising; they 
Reconstructing a 3D model of a scene captured by a sequence or a set of images is one of the main
